This is an application example implementing Swagger API documentation for the Anki-Medrec Platform project.  For the internal MedRegNG APIs project see , [visit this link](http://anki.medrec.oracleau.cloud).


## Installation

Follow the next step-by-step instructions on how to get, configure and deploy this application.


### 1.Install NodeJS and MongoDB.

The first step is to insatll NodeJS and MongoDB in your environment in case you haven't insatlled them. A simple way to ensure that ytou have not installed NodeJS and MongoDb in your environment is by attempting to retrieve their versions:

For example:
```
nodejs --version
mongo --version
```
If this does not return a valid version. Then proceed with the following instruction to install the missing packages. Otherwsie feel free to move to step 2.


Note: The following steps are for Ubuntu Linux distibutions, adjust accordsingly if using other OS (e.g. "yum" if using OEL/RH).

#### 1.1 Install NodeJS

```
sudo apt-get install curl -y
sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x |
sudo -E bash â€“
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y 
```
Validate the NodeJS installation:
```
mongo --version
```
You should get a valid version. I used NodeJS version 4.8.0 while building this application.

#### 1.2 Install MongoDB:

```
sudo apt-get install mongodb
```

Validate the MongoDB installation:
```
mongo --version

You should get a valid version. I used MongDB shell version 2.6.10 while building this application
